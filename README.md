This is my second school project.
It requires serious improvements, but the goal of the project has been fulfilled.
If you suddenly want to do something about it, then I won't mind.
To get the entire project, you need to download all 22 archives (it's not my fault that github does not allow downloading files larger than 25 MB) and unpack them into 1 folder.
